# Attention-based Deep Forest (ABDF)
This repository contains the code base for the Attention-based Deep Forest model, proposed in the [article](https://infocom.spbstu.ru/en/article/2023.77.1/).

The code is written in Python 3 language with usage of the [Bosk framework](https://github.com/NTAILab/bosk), so the model is compatible with the scikit-learn API. All the necessary code is located in the only [script](abdf.py). To run it, install the Bosk and Pytorch to your Python environment.
